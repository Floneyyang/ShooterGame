# ShooterGame
## Overview
This is a 2D top-down shooter game completed in C++ with SFML library. With the benefit of SFML library, I was able to create my own game loop, render a game window, and control time seperated from CPU.

The goal of this project is to learn more about backend engine programming.

## Process
As a game developer who is experienced with Unity engine and C# game programming, I learned a lot of new concepts and backend engine programming from this C++ project.

Using my knowledge of Unity infrastructure, I want to first create a game loop that supports Start(), Update(), and Draw() functions, and later add player/enemy data inside this code structure.

Moreover, I see the importance of using the Listener pattern in this project, which seperates input handler from input listeners to create more freedom for keyboard/mouse input to be used across different features.
